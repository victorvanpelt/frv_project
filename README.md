This repository contains all data and code used for a research project by Farah Arshad, Rainer Rilke, and Victor van Pelt
All co-auhors were equally involved in all stages of the research project.

### Data Collection
Using the [o-Tree](https://www.otree.org), we conducted the experiment on Amazon's mechanical Turk. Prior to running the experiment, we obtained approval to run the experiment from a certified institutional review board. Also, we informed participants about the ethical codes of conduct we followed prior to their participation.
