            In this first part, we ask you and one other participant to complete as many as 10 tasks from an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test as possible within 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            IQ represents a personâ€™s reasoning ability and intelligence relative to others or a peer group.

            <li>
                Both of you will receive $0.90 each for completing this first part.

        {% elif player.incentives == 1 %}
            <li>
                For this first part, the participant who completes the most IQ tasks correctly will receive $1.80 and the other participant will receive $0.00. In case of a tie, the faster participant will receive $1.80 and the other participant $0.00.
            </li>

            After part 1 but before part 2, you will observe whether you performed better or worse on the IQ tasks than the other participant.

        <li>
            After both part 1 and 2, you will observe whether you performed better or worse on the IQ tasks than the other participant.
